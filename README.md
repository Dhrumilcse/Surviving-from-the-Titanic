# Surviving from mthe Titanic
My first Kaggle competition submission which was ranked 0.79425 (Top 25%)

## Struggling?
I struggled to complete my first competition submission because of, I would say, improper resources. I went through kernels (read as 'articles') for this competition but all of them were not designed for beginners. I mean as a beginner, I don't want to see visualizations that I can't perform or interpret, I just need to understand what's happening in simple words.
But I finally made it. And If you are here because you too are struggling to get started with Kaggle, then my friend, you are in for a treat. No unnecessary lines of code or visualizations, just a straight path to your first submission.
